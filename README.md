UI Portfolio Website
Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website for a UI designer and web developer. The goal was to replicate the design and layout of a provided template, creating a professional and visually appealing site to showcase skills, services, portfolio, and contact information.
Solution Approach
The website was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and modern design. The approach involved:

Structure and Layout:

The website is divided into sections: Header, Hero, Services, Biography, Featured Skills, Portfolio, Stats, Skills List, and Footer.
Bootstrap's grid system was used for responsive layouts, ensuring the site looks great on all devices.
Navigation includes dropdown menus for Services, Blog, and Pages, mimicking the original design.


Styling:

A separate styles.css file was created to handle custom styling, including fonts, colors, and spacing.
The color scheme (dark teal, white, and green accents) and typography were matched to the original design.
Bootstrap classes were used for buttons, cards, and progress bars, with custom CSS overrides where needed.


Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure of the website.
CSS: For custom styling in styles.css.
Bootstrap 5.3: For responsive design, grid system, navigation, and components like cards and progress bars.
Bootstrap Icons: For icons used in the services, skills, and footer sections.


Interactivity:

Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle was included for dropdown menus and other interactive elements.
Links and buttons (e.g., "Hire Me", "Download CV") are set up but currently point to placeholder URLs (#).



File Structure

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
styles.css: Custom CSS file for styling the website.
